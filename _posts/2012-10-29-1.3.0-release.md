Today, we've shipped Groonga CloudSearch version 1.3.0 and Groonga CloudSearch Console 1.0.0. You can download the packages and read the tutorial on [the home page of this project site](/).

### What's new?

This release includes many many improvements, and they can be described as the following two topics.

#### CLI tools improvements

Now Groonga CloudSearch CLI tools communicate with Groonga CloudSearch Server via HTTP. You can configure your Groonga CloudSearch Server from the remote host.

#### Administrative console improvements

Groonga CloudSearch had a Web UI for configuration. Now it is separated from Groonga CloudSearch package itself. A new package [Groonga CloudSearch Console (groonga/gcs-console)](https://github.com/groonga/gcs-console) provides administrative Web console.

With Groonga CloudSearch Console, you can see your Groonga CloudSearch configuration, try searching, create and delete domain. In further releases, the dashboard will have more features.
