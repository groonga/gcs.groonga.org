Today, we've shipped Groonga CloudSearch version 1.4.0 and Groonga CloudSearch Console 1.1.0.
You can download the packages and read the tutorial on [the home page of this project site](/).

### What's new?

This release includes following two topics.

### Better compatibility to the Amazon CloudSearch

 * Search results are now sortable by "rank" option. Currently, only simple sort is supported. Custom rank expressions are not available yet.
 * Number of searchable documents is returned as a part of response from DescribeDomains.
 * "Arn" is now returned as part of domain statuses.
 * Error responses for CreateDomain, DeleteDomain, and DescribeDomains are now more compatible.

#### CLI tools improvements

Now Groonga CloudSearch CLI (Command Line Interface) tools accept "-e" (or "--endpoint") option to specify the endpoint of the configuration API. For example, if your remote Groonga CloudSearch server is accessible with the URI "http://gcs.example.com:7575/", then you'll run the gcs-describe-domain command like:

    $ gcs-describe-domain --endpoint=gcs.example.com:7575

or

    $ gcs-describe-domain -e gcs.example.com:7575

The gcs-post-sdf command had an option named "--endpoint" but it has been renamed to "--document-endpoint". "--endpoint" is now works as an option to specify the endpoint of the configuration API. So, if you have a search domain named "companies" on the remote service, you'll run the gcs-post-sdf command like:

    $ gcs-post-sdf --document-endpoint=doc-companies-xxxxxxx.gcs.example.com:7575

or

    $ gcs-post-sdf --endpoint=gcs.example.com:7575 --domain-name=companies

By thiese changes, now gcs-commands are incompatible to the old one.

#### Improvements as a daemon

Now, you can configure the Groonga CloudSearch daemon (Port number, host name, etc.) via /etc/default/gcs if you installed Groonga CloudSearch from the debian package.

Moreover, log files (access.log, error.log and query.log) are available at /var/log/gcs.
